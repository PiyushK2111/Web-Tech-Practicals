    <p>Established in 1999 under the GDR Educational Society for Higher & Technical Education by Shri Ghanshyam Dasji
        Rungta, Rungta College began as a single engineering institute. Under the visionary leadership of Group Chairman
        Santosh Rungta, it expanded into a renowned educational group comprising four colleges in Engineering, Pharmacy,
        Commerce, and Science. In 2025, with official government approval, it transformed into Rungta International
        University—Central India's first private skill-focused university. Located on an 80-acre campus in Bhilai, it
        offers NAAC A Grade accredited, industry-aligned UG, PG, and doctoral programs across disciplines with global
        certifications from Google, Microsoft, and IBM.</p>
